## Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (IE8 and below are not supported). Webpack needs Promise for import() and require.ensure(). If you want to support older browsers, you will need to load a polyfill before using these expressions.

## Environment

Webpack 5 runs on Node.js version 10.13.0+.
